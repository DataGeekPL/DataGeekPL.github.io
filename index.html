<h1>Oskar Jarczyk - senior data scientist</h1>
<h2>I deliver results through data science</h2>

<h3>About me</h3>

Computer science graduate, who decided to become a data scientist. 10+ years of experience in a software development. Finishing a PhD in the field of Social Informatics.

<h3>Sounds interesting?</h3>

<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Oskar - senior data scientist. I like challenges.</p>

<p>For the past 4 years I've worked for various companies, which I helped to make use of their big data. I do web mining and I am fluent in R, Java and Python programming languages. I'm familiar with NLP techniques, Big data Apache technology stack, and NoSQL database (e.g. MongoDB, Neo4J)</p>

<h3>My Skills</h3>

<h4>Clean And Efficient Code</h4>

Majority of data scientist don't care about their code, including excelent standards defined in the PIP8. I do care.

<h4>Visualizations</h4>

I know why pie charts sucks and I understand why people get nervous around box plots

<h4>Web Development</h4>

Models should be used by end customers and business, right?

<h4>Model Accuracy</h4>

There is always some space for improvement. I relentlessly try to follow Kaggle-like standards.
