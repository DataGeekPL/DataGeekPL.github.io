<h1>Oskar Jarczyk - senior data scientist</h1>
<h2>I deliver results through data science</h2>

<h3>About me</h3>

Computer science graduate, who decided to become a data scientist. 10+ years of experience in a software development. Finishing a PhD in the field of Social Informatics.

<h3>Sounds interesting?</h3>

<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Oskar - senior data scientist. I like challenges.</p>

<p>For the past 4 years I've worked for various companies, which I helped to make use of their big data. I do web mining and I am fluent in R, Java and Python programming languages. I'm familiar with NLP techniques, Big data Apache technology stack, and NoSQL database (e.g. MongoDB, Neo4J)</p>

<h3>My Skills</h3>

<h4>Clean And Efficient Code</h4>

Majority of data scientist don't care about their code, including excelent standards defined in the PIP8. I do care.

<h4>Visualizations</h4>

I know why pie charts sucks and I understand why people get nervous around box plots

<h4>Web Development</h4>

Models should be used by end customers and business, right?

<h4>Model Accuracy</h4>

There is always some space for improvement. I relentlessly try to follow Kaggle-like standards.

<h3>Specialization (services)</h3>

I'm offering full time engagement into data science, data engineering and R / Python programming projects. Legal agreement and TAX invoice (EU-registered VAT number). You can also invite me for your open-source software project or research grants.

<h4>Full stack data science</h4>

Full stack means delivering results from the whole process, starting from data cleaning and exploratory analysis, ending on putting model on a web application (e.g. SaaS) working in the cloud
 
<h4>Data engineering</h4>

ETL solutions which can process heavy data lifting, pipelining data- pre and post-processing, key-value databases (e.g. Redis), pipeline frameworks (e.g. Luigi) are no strangers for me

<h4>R programming</h4>

I like to use knitr for small tasks and exploratory data analysis, and I understand what are R circles of hell (and of course how to avoid them). Big love to data.table, dplyr, rcharts and parallel packages guaranteed
 
<h4>Python programming</h4>

Google "python 3 wall of superpowers" so you'll understand why I avoid Python 2 in favor of Python 3. Some of the python projets I maintain on GitHub and BB public repositories

<h4>Solving problems</h4>

Self-explanatory, more sophisticated problems provide more fun. As a proof, check my publications on the Google Scholar
