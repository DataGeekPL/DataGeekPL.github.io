    Fraud detection in retail stores/restaurants. Deep.BI uses AI pattern detection to analyze POS transaction data
    and detect employee fraud. We donâ€™t just look at transactions one-by-one; we analyze employee history and
    location aggregate data, along with in-transaction data about item deletes, item additions, refunds,
    and additional data, through neural networks and machine learning models
    to spot irregularities invisible to the human eye.
