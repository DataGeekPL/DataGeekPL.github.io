    Fastcat is a little Python library for quickly looking up broader/narrower relations in
    Wikipedia categories locally. The idea is that fastcat can be useful in situations where you need to rapidly
    lookup category relations, but don't want to abuse the Wikipedia API.

    I worked on multi-agent big data simulation and optimization problem for the maritime industry. Our system
    opitmized workflow of major ports in the America. Specialized operations research made for better performance
    of the port, higher ratio of found contraband, and finally, lowering costs. Produced recommendations were
    customer-tailored for every maritime port.
